## Descrição do Trabalho

Do you love coming up with mock-up concepts and best-practices?  
  
We are looking for a medical clinic website template that can be re-used for multiple medical practices by changing the color and other primary brand elements.  
  
We want 3 "pages" or views designed, for both desktop and mobile:  
1. Homepage. We want a homepage with "Hero" image, "our doctors" page and "contact" page. Show the primary CTA (call to action), 'book an appointment'.  
2. "Our Doctors". A page showing each doctor's photo, name and a 1 sentence bio.  
3. "Contact Us" should list the address with a map embedded, and a contact form.  
  
There should be navigation of some kind to access the above pages. The navigation should probably replicate teh primary CTA as well.  
  
The Contact Form should ask "How can we help you?", with options as follows:  
- Book an appointment - Button with "Click here to book online".  
- Medical question - Show a paragraph "For medical questions, you must speak with a medical professional directly. Please do not send your message here, and [book an appointment] instead."  
- Other - Just show a text box with 'send' button and 'your email address'.  
  
Other considerations:  
- Use a mobile-first design approach.  
- The design should be clean, modern, simple and minimal. Consider that we may have variations on the theme.  
- The design should have a certain look so the parent brand is still somewhat present (ie, SquareSpace templates tend to have a certain look). Some subtle but unique, original visual elements and styles can accomplish this.  
- The design should be user-friendly as a top priority, and help the user easily find information about the medical clinic, in order to decide to book.  
- The primary Call To Action is "Book an Appointment Online", which is a link that leads to demo.cortico.ca/book/  
- The style should express a balance of professionalism, innovation and caring at the same time.  
- The site should be generic enough that many clinics can use it, without it seeming too attached to their identity. Highlight the logo, title and hero image + other images to make each copy seem distinct.  
- The site should be Conversion Rate Optimized - follow principles of high conversion design like a repeated footer CTA, focused CTA sequences, testimonials + social proof. the main value prop of this service is to increase bookings.  
  
Inspiration: This template design on Dribbble is fairly close to what would work for this project -

This is a test task, intended to lead to further work if it goes well.  
  
If you are interested in this job, please include the words "I'm excited" in the first sentence of your reply to prove you're human and that you read this :)  
  
I look forward to hearing from you!
